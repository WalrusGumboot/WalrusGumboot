### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Simeon Duwel, but my online name is WalrusGumboot, a name I chose back when I really liked the Beatles. Oh well.  
I'm a Belgian student in my fourth year of secondary school. I study sciences.
Most of the things on here are personal projects, and a good portion of them don't work properly. Ideal to put on resumes ^v^

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge about computers in general.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the nitty-gritty of Assembly.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a cool project that benefits a large amount of people, e.g. an app that helps people with poor eyesight.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript or Python: I've got about seven years of experience in both!
- ðŸ“« To reach me, you can always send me an e-mail: tameimpalafan123 AT gmail DOT com. (*another* name I chose because I like a band. Jeez.) 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ In my spare time, I like to write, make music (check out my [Bandcamp](https://simeonduwel.bandcamp.com/releases) if you want to!) or listen to the Smiths.
